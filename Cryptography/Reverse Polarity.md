**Reverse Polarity - 30 Pts - Crypto**

Challenge :

*I got a new hard drive just to hold my flag, but I'm afraid that it rotted. What do I do? The only thing I could get off of it was this: 01000011010101000100011001111011010000100110100101110100010111110100011001101100011010010111000001110000011010010110111001111101*

So we can already notice that it is a purely binary message. If we want, we can decrypt it manually by using the ASCII table and refer to their original pattern. We always cuts bits in byte for good measure, which means 8 bits, in order to understand the messagge. Personally I like to use automated tools if I can use it after I understand the concept behind it.
Here's the flag, using CyberChef, a swiss-army knife for every crypto challenges & MUCH MUCH more :
