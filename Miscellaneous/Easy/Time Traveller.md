**Time Traveller - Miscellaneous - 20 Pts**

Challenge :

*Let's take a trip to nasa.gov on December 31, 1996. If you can tell me what email NASA listed on their website, I'll provide you with 10 points. Format: CTFlearn{email}*

Stay really focus on the challenge's statement they give us because i is the key in a Miscellaneous challenge, everything is possible in this category and it would be a shame to go to the opposite of what the challenge wants you to go.

So we got "Time Traveller" as a title, then it says to us to find a website at a certain date. Obviously for those who knows it looks crystal clear that we need to use the "Wayback Machine" which is a wonderful website to see what looks the url website had at this particular year and day ! Let's find it :
