**Rubber Duck - Forensics - 10 Pts**

Challenge :

*Find the flag! Simple forensics challenge to get started with.* + a file named "RubberDuck.jpg" attached to it.



So basically, the first things that comes to my mind after downloading an image file is to see what image is it, then check the metadata, then check if it is an embedded file. 

First of all the image is this and doesn't help us in any way for now, cute rubber duck though :

Let's see what the metadata give us :

Well, no need to search further, as we got the flag in the comment section.
