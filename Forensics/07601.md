Challenge :

*https://mega.nz/#!CXYXBQAK!6eLJSXvAfGnemqWpNbLQtOHBvtkCzA7-zycVjhHPYQQ I think I lost my flag in there. Hopefully, it won't get attacked...*

I applied `strings AGT.png` then found out that directory path was written in plain text so I used `binwalk` to extract the embed file in there :

Then we got a bunch of .zip file to unzip :

After doing it for the 3 .zip file (All 3 of them changed something in the `I warned you` file), I checked for any strings that could help for the challenge and luckily got the flag :
